This is a Next JS project that uses a Wordpress CMS.

I made this project while learning how to integrate frameworks like React JS and Next JS with a Content Management System.

Wordpress is a very popular CMS, this porject integrates with Wordpress CMS using GraphQL through a GraphQL plugin. The wordpress CMS is hosted on https://www.demoplatforms.net/ while this project is hosted on Vercel at https://next-wp-homes.vercel.app/

I learnt a lot on this project because I was able to integrate the ease-of-use and accesibility of Wordpress CMS with the perks of NextJS such as fast loading times, "Lazy loading" for images, Reusable components and SEO.
